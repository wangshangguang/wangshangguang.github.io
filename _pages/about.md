  <p><strong>December 9, 2023</strong>: At 7:39 AM on December 9th, the Zhuque-2 YAO-3 launch vehicle was successfully launched from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in China. It successfully placed the Tianyi-33 Satellite into its designated orbits. The Tianyi-33 satellite is a 50kg class space science experimental satellite equipped with an operating system independently developed by Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications—the Rust-based dual-kernel real-time operating system RROS (<a href="https://github.com/BUPT-OS/RROS">GitHub link</a>). RROS will carry out general tasks represented by tensorflow/k8s and real-time tasks represented by real-time file systems and real-time network transmission on the satellite. It will ensure the normal execution of upper-layer applications and scientific research tasks, such as time-delay measurement between satellite and ground, live video broadcasting, onboard web chat services, pseudo-SSH experiments, etc. This marks the official application of a Rust-written dual-kernel operating system in a satellite scenario.</p>
